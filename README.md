Repository contains:

* [Avatar Biosignal Visualizations (Heart Rate, Breathing Rate)](source)


Example visualizations:
![Example Skeuomorphjic](imgs/chi2022_avatarbiosignals_example_skeuomorphic.gif)

![BiosignalVisualizationPackage.unitypackage](source/BiosignalVisualizationPackage.unitypackage) is a unity package file that includes biosignal visualizations with an example simulated biosignal. (This file does not include the jazz bar background.)

Follow the instruction to use the file:
1) Open Unity3D with the 'Universal Render Pipeline' template.
2) Import the package to Unity.
3) Read BiosignalManager.cs script to understand how the sample file works.
4) Adjust the BiosignalManager.cs and ExampleBiosignal.csv file if you want to make use of the visualizations for other projects.
