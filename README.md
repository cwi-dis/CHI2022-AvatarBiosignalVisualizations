## Source Code

<!-- * [Avatar Biosignal Visualizations (Heart Rate, Breathing Rate)](source) -->

[BiosignalVisualizationPackage.unitypackage](source/BiosignalVisualizationPackage.unitypackage) is a Unity package file that includes biosignal visualizations with an example simulated biosignal. Note: This file does not include the jazz bar background.

Please follow the below instructions to get started:

1. Open Unity3D with the 'Universal Render Pipeline' template.
2. Import the package to Unity.
3. Read BiosignalManager.cs script to understand how the sample file works.
4. Adjust the BiosignalManager.cs and ExampleBiosignal.csv file if you want to make use of these visualizations in other projects.

## Supplementary Material

* [Supplementary material:](supplementary_material)
    -  A_vis_overview.mp4: Teaser video showing an overview of each biosignal visualization situated in the virtual jazz bar. Shows a view of the companion avatar as well as of the audience.

    - B_vis_detailed.mp4: Video showing each biosignal visualization (heart rate and breathing rate) across the three different signal rates tested: low, rest, and high.

    - C_post-hoc_interactions.pdf: A document showing the full set of pos-hoc interactions for perceived avatar arousal and for perceived distraction resulting from the contrast tests run with the ART-C tool. Refers to Sec. 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 in the paper.
